# Infinite Scroll

This project is about creating an Infinite Scroll component that allows not only smooth scrolling down to fetch new records, but also allows the user to scroll up, going back to previously fetched pages. Conceptually, if the data in the fetched pages changes, the solution will dynamically update them.
